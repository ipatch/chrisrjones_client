## Working with CORS

<strong>webpack-dev-server</strong> can be configured to work with CORS, ie. a react based app can send an AJAX request using vanilla JS, or even using a promise based library such **axios** to make an AJAX request. I setup a very primitive AJAX request to experiment with CORS in dev.  Working with CORS is still a total PITA but can be used to get things work.  See changes made to the **webpack.config.dev.js** for settings related to CORS and webpack configuration.  An honorable mention, make certain to disable credentials when making a AJAX request with **axios** in local development.

If an API is setup properly to handle CORS requests, ie. the rails API I've setup and the **webpack dev server** properly then the last piece of the jig saw puzzle is make sure the web browser is setup properly.

#### Working with CORS > web browser

The **webpack-dev-server** configured in this app should work out of the box with Firefox on macOS without any browser extensions.  However using a browser such Vivaldi requires a [browser extension](https://github.com/vitvad/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) to work with the CORS requests and responses.

##### Working with CORS > web browsers > Firefox

Firefox should not have a problem accessing,

```conf
http://localhost:4000
```

##### Working with CORS > web browser > Chromium based browsers

When accessing the client side app, avoid using the below web address / URL

```conf
http://localhost:4000
```

...instead use the below URLs when accessing the client app in **dev**.

```conf
http://[LOCAL.IP.ADDRESS]:[PORT]
http://10.0.1.8:4000
```

## Updates

### Updates > Feb 18, 2020

- [x] Experimented with creating a class based component for fetching data from an API using react.
- [ ] Created a Functional based component using react hooks to fetch data from an API, **no work**.
  - [source, medium article](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-fetch-data-from-an-api-with-react-hooks-9e7202b8afcd)

- **@babel/polyfill** has been deprecated in favor of setting a **corejs** value within the **.babelrc**

- add **axios** pkg to make AJAX calls to rails API

- added [**webapp-webpack-plugin**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webapp-webpack-plugin) to generate favicons for various systems and platforms. Copied the svg that is part of **create-react-app** to be the favicon for this project.

- added **prettier** to project via NPM to make all **.js** files conform to a single Javascript code formatting standard.

To run **prettier** from a CLI

```shell
npx prettier --write "src/**/*.js"
```

- **webpack-dev-server** will default to port **8080**, and if that port is not available it will increment until it finds an available port to bind to.

```conf
http://localhost:8080
```

- Added support for CSS source maps using [extract-css-chunks-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/faceyspacey/extract-css-chunks-webpack-plugin)
