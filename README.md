## Updates

- add **axios** pkg to make AJAX calls to rails API

- added [**webapp-webpack-plugin**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webapp-webpack-plugin) to generate favicons for various systems and platforms. Copied the svg that is part of **create-react-app** to be the favicon for this project.

- added **prettier** to project via NPM to make all **.js** files conform to a single Javascript code formatting standard.

To run **prettier** from a CLI

```shell
npx prettier --write "src/**/*.js"
```

- **webpack-dev-server** will default to port **8080**, and if that port is not available it will increment until it finds an available port to bind to.

```conf
http://localhost:8080
```

- Added support for CSS source maps using [extract-css-chunks-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/faceyspacey/extract-css-chunks-webpack-plugin)
